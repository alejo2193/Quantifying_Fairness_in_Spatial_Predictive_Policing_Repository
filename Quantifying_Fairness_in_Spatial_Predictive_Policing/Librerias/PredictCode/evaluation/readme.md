# Evaluating hotspots

In this folder, we consider ways of comparing the outputs of predictions to what really happened: that is, "scoring" predictions.  We will also, in the future, consider other properties of predictions which might be of interest.

### Introduction

- [Comparing predictions](Comparing%20prediction%20outputs.ipynb)


### Comparison methods

- [Hit rate](Hit%20Rate.ipynb)
- [Rank ordering](Rank%20ordering.ipynb)
- [Likelihood](Likelihood.ipynb)
- [Kernel Density Estimation](Kernel Density Estimation.ipynb)
- [Scoring rules](Scoring%20functions.ipynb)
- [Wavelet decompositions](Wavelet%20decompositions.ipynb) - Work in progress
- [Bayesian + Information Theoretic ideas](Bayesian%20+%20Information%20Theoretic%20ideas.ipynb)

### Examples

- [Comparison with synthetic data](Comparison%20with%20synthetic%20data.ipynb)

### Future work

- [Properties of hotspots](Properties of hotspots.ipynb)
