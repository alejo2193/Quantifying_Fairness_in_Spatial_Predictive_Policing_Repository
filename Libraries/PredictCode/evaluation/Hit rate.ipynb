    "# Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a coverage level, say 10% (or 5%, or 20%).  Select this percentage of the grid cells, from most risky to least risky, according to the prediction.  In e.g. [1] this is refered to as forming the \"hotspot\".  We then regard a future crime event as \"captured\" if it falls in the selected area.  Calculate the percentage of events captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we issue predictions for times $t_1 < t_2 < \\cdots < t_n$, typically using all available information before time $t_i$ when forming the prediction for time $t_i$.  Each prediction is valid for a time period $s_i$; typically each $s_i=s$ (say, one day) and $t_{i+1} =t_i +s$, but this is not strictly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each prediction at time $t_i$ we form the selected region (the \"hotspot\") and calculate the fraction of captured events, say $x_i \\in [0,1]$.  This yields a sequence $(x_i)$, and it is common to report a summary statistic of the $(x_i)$ (e.g. the mean, inter-quartile range, etc.)"

    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "For a _fixed_ study region, coverage is in direct proportion to area.  However, when comparing different regions, or even potentially different grid sizes, it is more sensible to select on area.  In [1], this idea of normalising by area is termed the \"search efficiency rate\"."

    "\n",
    "- Easy to understand.\n",
    "- Easy to compute.  It is computationally efficient to calculate a range of coverages at the same time.\n",
    "- Depends only on the relative risk, and hence might be better suited to some of the \"a-theoretical\" prediction methods."

    "\n",
    "- We might worry about the [MAUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem) in that a crime event is either \"captured\" or not, regardless of how close or far it is from being in a covered cell.  _In our experiments, we have found that changing the grid positioning alone can lead to a noticably change in hit rate._\n",
    "- It is not clear which summary statistic(s) to report.  The mean is commonly the only value used.  [2] reports the [Standard Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).\n",
    "- The major difference in performance between different prediction algorithms seems, in our experiments, to be due to _qualitative_ changes in the shape of the \"hot-spots\".  It is thus not clear if we are really comparing like with like (for example, from a policing operations perspective).  For this reason, it is common to also report some summary statistic(s) about the shape of the hot-spots."
